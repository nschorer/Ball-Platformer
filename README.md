# Ball-Platformer
A 3D platformer in Unity.

'Most recent build' contains all current levels.
If you use the PC build, download the whole folder labeled "PC". The .exe will only run if "Ball Platformer_Data" is present in the same directory as the .exe.

'Ball Platformer - limited' contains the Unity project, but omits most of the levels and some of the code.
